# NeuroCausal: meta-analysis

The base code of NeuroCausal, a platform for meta-analysis of the neuropsychological data inspired by [NeuroQuery](https://github.com/neuroquery/neuroquery).

Given a cognitive/psychological term (e.g. face processing), it produces a brain map of the brain area whose integrity is necessary to enable such processe/representation (e.g. a lesion in that area would lead to prosopagnosia).

If you would like to know more about our mission and goals, please read [our blogposts](https://neurocausal.github.io/posts/)


## Getting started

Please check our [Guidelines for Contributors](https://github.com/neurocausal/neurocausal/blob/main/contribution_guidelines.md). This guideline is currently under construction and soon will have necessary details regarding the technical aspect of the package too!

### Dependencies

The development of the NeuroCausal meta-analysis pipeline will be built on [NeuroQuery](https://github.com/neuroquery/neuroquery) metaanalysis and [NeuroQuery Data Collection](https://github.com/neuroquery/nqdc) packages. 

### Installation
We would like you to install both NeuroQuery packages by following the commands below:

To install the main repo version of the NQDC, type

`pip install git+https://github.com/neuroquery/nqdc.git`

To install the NeuroQuery type 

`pip install neuroquery`

The packages will install additional packages listed in their requirement lists they list in their repository what NeuroCausal will be also sticking with. 

If you do not want the versions of the listed packages in your codebase to change you can also create a new conda environment following the instructions [here](https://github.com/neurocausal/neurocausal_meta/#setting_up_a_conda_virtual_environment.md)

### Usage

Querying, downloading, and filtering the openly accessible clinical publications and metaanalysis of the brain functioning associated with the clinical cases.
